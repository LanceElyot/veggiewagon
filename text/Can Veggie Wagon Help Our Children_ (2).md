![Apple in hand][Apple] [^^^^note]

>My sister was around six years old when I heard an alarming statement spoken by her. “Carrie, are we going to go get apples from the apple store?” I asked her if she knew where apples came from and she nodded her head with confidence and replied, “the apple store”. I was shocked to realize that my little sister did not know apples came from apple trees. I pondered this and decided to push further. “Do you know where eggs come from?” and she replied, “the egg store”. How could this be something I never realized she was being deprived of; this knowledge to the inner workings of our world. And then it dawned on me. She had never seen a hen lay and sit on an egg, or a chick hatch from an egg. She had never had the pleasure of climbing to the tallest heights of an apple tree to pick that perfectly juicy, red, yellow, or green fruit. How many other children in our society are being denied this pleasure and how many adults realize this? 

## Children and food knowledge by the numbers  
### In the [UK](https://foodfreedom.news/2017-09-07-children-have-pitiful-knowledge-of-where-food-comes-from.htm)[^note]
* 1 in 5 children do not know what animal eggs come from. 
* 1 in 10 think chocolate grows on trees just as they see it in the grocery stores.
* 20% of children could not identify a raspberry. 
* 11% of children think milk comes right from the grocery stores. 

### In the [United States](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/15/seven-percent-of-americans-think-chocolate-milk-comes-from-brown-cows-and-thats-not-even-the-scary-part/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a4fdac27ffb9)[^^note]
* 4 in 10 did not realize hamburgers are made from cow meat. 
* 3 in 10 did not realize milk is used to make cheese. 
* 50% of kids surveyed did not realize pickles are from cucumbers, and that onions and lettuce are in fact plants. 

These studies show that somewhere along the line children have lost touch with the reality of where their food on their plate comes from. My sister, like many young children today, grew up in an urbanized neighborhood with adults that have little or no connections to farming practices. This is a concern because the loss of connection can hinder health, well-being, and skills in personal and social realms.[^^^note] This connectioin grounds children, it helps them realize their interdependence with other humans and nature.

### Are adults any better? 
![women grocery shoppoing][women][^^^^^note]
We adults may understand that foods we purchase do not grow at the grocery store but how often do we think about where it was grown? Do we consider the farmer and what it took to ensure the growth of the plants? What about how the climate is impacting the growth of farmers produce or how farms may be contributing to climate change?[^^^^^^note] Many adults seem to be losing connection, forgetting the background that comes with every bit of produce and product we buy. As we forget to remember, so do our children and the generation after them. Less and less farmers are being remembered and less are being supported. To forget these farmers are we now forgetting to pay attention to our own health and wellness?

### What it means for a child?
> Ten years later and my sister since has climbed that apple tree and picked herself that ripe, juicey, red apple for herself. She has been given her own space of dirt to till, sow, and harvest. Her first job at a small town cafe that sources locally. Her new found love for her own picked food  propels her toward the art of culinary. The enlightenment empowers her to bring others into this relationship they too can have with their food. This deeper connection can begin with her prepared locally sourced meals. She has found her pleasure, joy, passion, and center.
