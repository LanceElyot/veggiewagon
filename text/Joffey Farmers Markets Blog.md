Some of the best days from my time as a college student in sunny central Florida were spent every Sunday at the local farmers market at Lake Eola Park. Big white tents lined the main sidewalk as people and their accompanying four-legged friends walked the aisle. While entering the market, a large smile always crept on my face because all I saw and felt surrounding me was happiness. Happy farmers who were experiencing all their hard work pay off, happy people who could not wait to go home to cook up the fresh and delicious food they purchased, and, of course, the happy canines who were ecstatic to be outdoors surrounded by the sweet aroma of food. Farmers markets are a celebration of life. They are a celebration of the food and flora this stunning earth graciously grants us and they are a celebration of the people who commit their lives to providing those earthly gifts to others. At a time when people seem so disconnected from their neighbors and the natural world, farmers markets remind us of the beauty and the unity we share with each other and with this beautiful planet we call home. 

## Our Food System Today

1,500 miles. That is the average amount of miles meals travel in the United States to get from the farm to the plate according to a [study](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/how_far_did_your_food_travel_to_get_to_you) conducted by Michigan State University. As an environmental scientist, I frequently ponder on the impracticality of our industrial agricultural system. We import and export foods that don’t need to be imported or exported. Why food is being shipped thousands of miles is a question me and other colleagues have been asking ourselves for a long time. 

## Benefits of Eating Local 

Choosing to eat food grown locally has many benefits. For instance: 
* **Locally grown food is healthier and tastier**. Food less traveled contains more of the essential nutrients our bodies need. When food travels far distances, its nutrient content decreases as it sits in distribution warehouses. For instance, scientists [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17852499) that imported broccoli contained only half the vitamin C as local broccoli. Furthermore, locally grown food is more flavorful since it is always in season. 
* **Locally grown food is not “artificially ripened”**. Calcium Carbide (CaC2) is frequently utilized in many countries such as India, Pakistan, and Nepal for speeding up the ripening process of fruits that end up in our local grocery stores. However, CaC2 use has been [shown](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229429873_Eating_Artificially_Ripened_Fruits_is_Harmful) to contain traces of arsenic and phosphorus hydride, toxic chemicals that lead to numerous acute and chronic health issues.    
* **Local food helps support the local economy**. Buying food close to home helps keep local farmers in business. Furthermore, the money you give them is reinvested into businesses within your community, helping promote a healthy economy. 
* **Local food aids the environment**. By purchasing locally grown foods, you are helping combat large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions), the transportation sector is responsible for the most amount of greenhouse gas emissions than any other economic sector in the United States. 

 ## What You Can Do 
 
You can begin sourcing your food from local farmers instead of your local grocery store, like I did. This website provided by the [USDA](https://www.ams.usda.gov/local-food-directories/farmersmarkets) is a great tool to utilize to look for farmers markets in your area. From my experience, buying local produce is cheaper than going to my local grocery store and as a college student, this is just one more added benefit. Overall, eating local food is the solution your body and the environment needs. Not only is locally sourced food immensely healthier for your body, buying food close to home supports your local economy and helps make a difference in the fight for preserving this beautiful planet.
