**Summer is in full swing** and that means berries galore from your favorite local farmers. The first berries to make their debut this summer are plump and juicy strawberries from [Cottle Farms](https://www.cottlefarms.com/berries) Cottle Farms’ family-owned production has been growing berries for Eastern North Carolina since 1964, and it’s not hard to see why. Strawberries are one of the first fruits to ripen in the spring and the sturdy varieties of today have greatly improved their transportability, making the short one-hour trip from Cottle Farms to our customers a bruise-less journey. 

In addition to their delectable taste, strawberries hold a fascinating place in human history. According to the University of Missouri, strawberries. were used to treat everything from feeling the blues to kidney stones in ancient Rome. They were carved in stone in Medieval times to represent perfection and righteousness. Even one of Napoleon's court members supposedly regularly bathed in 22 pounds of fresh strawberry juice in an attempt to soak up their purported healing properties.

Today’s commercial strawberries look quite different from the little wild nubs native to five continents. A member of the rose family, today’s plump heart-shaped gems provide 140 percent of recommended daily calcium in just eight berries, average 200 seeds per fruit, and are grown in every state in the country.  Here at The Veggie Wagon our strawberries are something special. Farmers like the folks over at Cottle Farms sifted through more than 100 varieties of strawberries in the world to find the five perfect plants for our region where the summers are hot and humid and the winters are short and mild. Those five varieties, Camarosa, Festival, Chandler, Sweet Charlie, and Camino Real, come together to offer the sweetest, tastiest selection available. Whether their sliced fresh on top of your favorite scoop of ice cream, sandwiched between shortcake, or dolloped with cream, we’ve made sure that each one is fresh, local, and delicious.

**Ah, squash!** Growing your own can be the gift that keeps on giving, but in Southeastern North Carolina you might find yourself fighting off hungry pests all season long instead of taking in a bounty of this summer favorite. That’s right, we aren’t the only ones who love this versatile vegetable! The vines of summer squash plants are a favorite for [Melittia cucurbitae](http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/veg/leaf/squash_vine_borer.htm), a black and white wasp-like moth, to lay their eggs on. When the eggs hatch, the larvae (aptly called vine borers) burrow into the vines to munch their way to pupation. 

Ironically, it’s not their appetite that impacts the plant, but rather their voluptuous circumference. Unlike caterpillars or worms that eat through the fruit of a plant, vine borers hunker down in the vines and actually end up interrupting the flow of [nutrients and water]( https://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/squash-vine-borer
). One of the telltale signs of vine borers is a well-watered squash plant with sad and droopy leaves. And once these creepy crawlers find their way in, there’s no guaranteed organic or even chemical way to treat them. Carefully dissecting the vine and removing the borers with tweezers or (gulp!) [stabbing](https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-insects/squash-vine-borers 
) them with a needle or knife is the only way to ensure their removal. 

Rather than getting borer blood on your hands, leave the squash-growing to our network of local and organic farmers. They know all the tricks of the trade to keep their plants borer-free throughout the season, and boy have they delivered! We’re swimming in squash here at The Veggie Wagon and it’s ready to be stewed, fried,  or grilled along with your favorite summer dishes. Stop on in and fill your plate today!
