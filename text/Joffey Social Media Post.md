Tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet potatoes, blackberries, strawberries, and apples. These are just a few of the vegetables and fruits that are able to grow in our beautiful state of North Carolina. However, when you shop at the local grocery store, you are buying produce that has journeyed hundreds of miles and artificially ripened with chemicals. We are a produce company dedicated to changing this! Our goal is to provide local North Carolina fruits, vegetables, and other delicious homemade products, while also supporting our local farming community. Check out this blog post to learn more about the many benefits of eating local and take a look at our delivery area map below. We have two storefront locations,12 grab-n-go cooler locations, and an online ordering system to better serve you!
