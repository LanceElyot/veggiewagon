## How Buying Local Can Save Our Oceans
### By Stephanie McMillan

##### The Problem with Plastic
Grocery stores are a sea of plastic. But when I walk through a local farmer's market, the only packaging I see is the rinds of local fruit or the skin of fresh vegetables.

As a UNCW student minoring in Environmental Studies, this lack of packaging is obviously a welcome sight to me. But citizens from every age and walk of life feel the same as me without having to receive a lecture on plastic pollution every day.
 
Wilmington's identity has been built upon the sea, yet the greatest threat to our oceans—plastic—is still the material of choice at large retailers. According to the Wilmington-based advocacy group [Plastic Ocean Project](http://www.plasticoceanproject.org/about-us.html), 80% of marine pollution is plastic, a material which [some scientists estimate might take up to 1000 years to break down](https://www.torontoenvironment.org/how_long_does_it_take_for_a_plastic_bag_to_break_down). Even worse, single-use plastic bags have yet to be banned in NC, despite the numerous calls for change.

##### How Buying Local Can Change Things
However, a solution to this problem is closer to home than many realize. Aside from contributing to the local economy and public health, farmers' markets use an extraordinarily small amount of plastic. Produce is displayed in open-air crates, and artisan products like handmade soaps, jewelry, and clothing opt for paper labels, if anything at all.

Too, while farmers' markets are often noted for decreasing the fossil fuels associated with transporting produce, these fossil fuels are further decreased by the lack of petroleum going into making plastic packaging. Based on my trip to The Veggie Wagon, I also noticed the following sustainable practices in play at local markets:
- Reusable bags were displayed prominently for sale in the front of the store
- Paper packaging was utilized more extensively
- Products are emphasized for quality over quantity


I believe the plastic problem can be solved with us. Though legislation has yet to truly address this issue, citizens can help by supporting local organizations like The Veggie Wagon.

Wilmington is beloved by all of its citizens for its pristine beachesÑlet's love it back by living sustainably.
