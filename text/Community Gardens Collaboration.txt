#Community Gardens Collaboration: Facebook Event Post

Join us at [time] on [date] at the **Annie Nixon Community Garden** as we partner with Wilmington Green to highlight the importance of access to fresh, local produce!

We will offer taste testings of our most popular items and host a cooking demonstration at [time]. Wilmington Green will provide tips for getting involved with the community garden and how to make the most of the experience. 

Children can decorate a small decorative pot and plant a seed to take home. 

Please RSVP and share the event with your friends. See you there!
