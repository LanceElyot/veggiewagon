# Social Media Post: Farmer Feature Example
*Since I do not know any of the farmers that provide goods to The Veggie Wagon, I created this example post using a farm where I grew up picking strawberries with my family- Garner Farms in Newport, NC.*

"The 3rd generation Garner siblings have all had their involvement with the farm." Garner Farms is a true example of farming running in the family. What started as a farm to grow tobacco, corn, and soybeans is now famous for seasonal vegetables, fresh cut flowers, and pick-your-own strawberries. "Folks would come from all over the area to pick strawberries for canning and freezing and the tradition still stands today."

Tune in **today at 3:00pm E.S.T** for our Facebook live stream with the Garner Farms family to tour the farm.
